# PROGRESS  

Tried to get fly to work without succes.
I was also unable to use "getenv", and thus had to hard code the secret key and URI into the app.py file.


The site has main functionalities such as login, register, group creation and project creation.

The project page itself is displayed when clicked, but the file sharing functionalty has not yet been implememted.

#HOW TO TEST

1. Create the sql schema using the schema.sql file.
